# surfs_up
## Overview

  This project is a business proposal  for a Surf’n Shake shop in Hawaii. A potential investor and surfing connoisseur has concerns, from previous experience, about the impact climate  will have on the venture. Our potential investor has provided a weather dataset that he wants analyzed and included in the proposal. Building on a SQL foundation of data structures and querying methods, we will analyze the presented weather dataset, create an app and build a route to display the analyze database via webpage.

### Data Environment:

- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask
- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Results

-  December had a higher recorded change in temperatures (30°-\+) than June’s of (20° -/+). These measurements indicate a higher variability in December’s temperature to look out for.
- Although June is a prime summer month and December is a prime winter month the calculated average temperature for December is only 4 degree less than that of June. Denoting comparable weather in the Summer months and during Winter months, which can be beneficial
- Precipitation above '0.0' was observed only 32 more times in June than in December over a 7 year span. Denoting low rainfall

## Summary
	
  June and December’s high temperature central tendencies over a 7 year span have proven to be closely comparable, with very slim variability, which would make the location favorable year round. Oahu’s June and December precipitation records are considerably low and therefore, negligible. Based on the data provided, the investor’s concern of weather can officially be waved.  However, Even with the positive weather data I would not advocate jumping head first into waves and shakes just yet. I would recommend some additional experimental studies in:
 - wind speeds to determine the consistency and length of waves, 
 - wave swell size vs. frequency, to establish attractiveness of surfability, and possibly even,
 - The average hours of daylight per day at all the stations.
 - The average hours of daylight per day at all the stations.
 
  If our potential investor and his board of directors wants to revist our analysis later, it can be easily accessed thru our Flask weather app!!!
